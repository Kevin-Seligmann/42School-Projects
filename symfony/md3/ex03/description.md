Create a Elem cass that represents an allowed HTML tag.

The constructor must take the tag and the content (if).

The method pushElement, adds a new element to the content of the tag.

A function getHTML outputs the element as HTML code. And if it containes other elements, they also should be rendered.

The TemplateEngine classs should have a constructor with an Elem. The function createFile($fileName) should render the output to a HTML file.

Create an index.php to test the class.
